			<h2>Majoring in Strategic Design and Management</h2>
			<p>As I embark on this new semester, I am eager to delve into the world of coding—a skill that holds immense value for my career aspirations. I am optimistic that the well-designed class structure will facilitate a swift and comprehensive grasp of the subject matter. Collaboratively, as a class, we can foster a supportive space where questions are encouraged and mistakes are viewed as stepping stones toward growth. As I simultaneously pursue studies in Strategic Design and Management and minoring in Communication Design, adding the dimension of coding to my skill set will undoubtedly contribute to my broader goal of proficiency in graphic design.</p>
