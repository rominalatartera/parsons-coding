		<h2>What is fast fashion?</h2>
		<div>
		<p>The term describes the quick turnover of fashion trends and the move towards cheap, mass-produced clothing - with new lines constantly released.<p>
		Fast fashion is the term used to describe clothing designs that move quickly from the catwalk to stores to take advantage of trends. The collections are often based on styles presented at Fashion Week runway shows or worn by celebrities. Fast fashion allows mainstream consumers to purchase the hot new look or the next big thing at an affordable price.

	<p>Fast fashion became common because of cheaper, speedier manufacturing and shipping methods, an increase in consumers' appetite for up-to-the-minute styles, and the increase in consumer purchasing power—especially among young people—to indulge these instant-gratification desires. Because of all this, fast fashion is challenging the established clothing labels' tradition of introducing new collections and lines on an orderly, seasonal basis. In fact, it's not uncommon for fast-fashion retailers to introduce 
	new products multiple times in one week to stay on trend.<p/>


		
		<h2>What's the environmental impact of fast fashion?</h2>
		<p>Producing clothes uses a lot of natural resources and creates greenhouse gas emissions which are responsible for climate change.

Overall, the fashion industry is responsible for 8-10% of global emissions, according to the UN - more than the aviation and shipping combined.

And global clothes sales could increase by up to 65% by 2030, the World Bank suggests.

Most of fashion's environmental impact comes from the use of raw materials:

cotton for the fashion industry uses about 2.5% of the world's farmland
synthetic materials like polyester require an estimated 342 million barrels of oil every year
clothes production processes such as dying requires 43 million tonnes of chemicals a year
The industry also uses a lot of water.<p/>

			 <p> The fashion industry is responsible for 8-10% of global emissions - and British shoppers buy more clothes than any others in Europe.<p/>
			<p>Now, some UK brands are being investigated over claims about the sustainability of their fashion lines. What can you do to reduce your wardrobe's impact on the planet?<p/>

<h2>Who buys fast fashion?</h2>
<p>UK shoppers buy more clothes per person than those in any other country in Europe, according to MPs.

Young people top that list. A recent survey by environmental charity Hubbub found that more than 
two-fifths of 16 to 24-year-olds buy clothes online at least once a week, compared to 13% on average 
for other age groups.<p/>

		<h2>How can you reduce your fashion footprint?</h2>
	<p>The UN has launched the #ActNow Fashion Challenge to highlight how industry and individuals can help improve fashion's environmental impact.

It says that reducing the fashion industry's carbon footprint "is key to limiting [global] warming".

Make clothes more sustainably

Several firms have launched "eco" collections which use organic and recycled materials, including H&M Conscious, Adidas x Parley and Zara Join Life.

But critics argue such collections don't solve the biggest problem - overconsumption.<p/>
