            <h1>ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€ Welcome to my Creative Odyssey! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨</h1>
                <p>Hey there, curious soul! I'm thrilled to have you step into my digital realmâ€”a fusion of strategic design, business acumen, and a mad love for all things creative.
                    
                    I'm the Strategic Design and Management maverick from Parsons, with a twist: I'm on a mission to rock the world of business with a hefty dose of graphic design magic. With a minor in Communication Design, I'm here to show you that numbers and spreadsheets aren't the only players in the corporate game.
                    
                    Prepare to feast your eyes on a journey where pie charts meet color palettes and market trends dance with typography. Dive into my portfolio, where every pixel embodies strategic thinking intertwined with artistic flair.
                    
                    As you stroll through my projects, you'll witness the harmonious collision of strategic prowess and visual charisma. From crafting compelling brand identities that scream "notice me" to designing campaigns that make trends, this is where the art of business meets the business of art.
                    
                    But wait, it's not all about meâ€”I'm eager to collaborate, ideate, and create alongside fellow adventurers. Whether you're a fellow student, a fellow design addict, or a fellow dreamer, let's connect and cook up some mind-blowing projects.
                    
                    So buckle up, my friend! You're about to witness a symphony of strategic design sprinkled with the enchanting magic of creativity. Ready to be inspired? Let's embark on this journey together. ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰

                                    <p class="clear-float"> My family are the people that make me who I am and the people that symbolize love, union and loyalty in my life. My mom is one of the reasonâ€™s I am pursuing a career related to design, because she has shown me her excellent tastes in fashion, her knowledge in architecture, her wishes to study graphic design and her creativeness through my life. On the other hand, I admire my dad because he has shown me leadership, business, positiveness and a more scientific side of things. Also, I am blessed with two sisters, so there are mostly women in the house (that is why my dad wanted a dog, so he wouldnâ€™t be the only man in the house), and I learn countless things from them every day. And I would never forget to mention my dog, that puts a smile on everybodyâ€™s face when he is around, he shows me how the little things in life can matter so much.</p>
                                    

                                <h3 id="core2">My Country and Culture:</h3>
                                    <p>I am from Venezuela and I am a Latin-American, this is where I grew up and this culture has had a great influence in my life. This place is mostly warm and not only because of the temperature, but also because of the kindhearted people. Sadly, over the last decades it has been deteriorating and is now found in an economic, political and social crisis. This has also played part in how I see the world; it makes me very thankful of everything, of all the good things I have, of all the good moments and the bad that I learn from.</p>

                                    <p>My school is where I made most of the friendships I have till today and where I learned about my religion, my faith: Catholicism. These aspects have formed me as the young woman a I am today; it is my second home and the place where I have lived so many experiences, good and bad.</p>
