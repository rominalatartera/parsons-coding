				<h2>Develop your Idea</h2>
				<p>My website aims to showcase my journey as a Strategic Design and Management student at Parsons, emphasizing my passion for graphic design and its fusion with the business world. It's a dynamic portfolio highlighting projects demonstrating my ability to combine strategic thinking with creative flair. Additionally, the website serves as a platform for connection and collaboration, inviting like-minded individuals, potential partners, and fellow enthusiasts to engage in conversations and explore the nexus of design and business. Ultimately, it's a space where I share my passion, expertise, and vision for bridging strategic insights with captivating design.<span>
				<h2>Discovery and Research</h2>
				<p>During my research, I decided to make my website a place where people can just go in and feel they understand who I am as a professional and as a person. To understand my mind and my style so they know what to expect. I chose Beatriz Faria’s work as my inspiration because she’s selling herself as a brand. <span>
				<h2>Website Inspiration</h2>
				<p>Beatriz Faria is an ambitious, proactive, conceptual, and creative graphic designer who loves working with fearless brands that believe design makes a difference. The website fully introduces a selection of her best work as a multidisciplinary graphic designer, from branding to hands-on design, editorial, motion, art direction, and much more. <span>

		<h2>Target your Audience </h2>
		<p>The website portfolio for a Parsons student in Strategic Design and Management, also minoring in Communication Design, shapes a brand that's classy, pro-level, and bursting with creative vibes. The vibe lands right in the middle of pro and innovative, reflecting a mix of intelligent strategy and artsy passion. It's like blending the smarts of strategic design with the artsy flair of graphic design – no sweat.
		<p>The brand comes across as expensive yet chill, appealing to a mix of folks – students, pros, and those who dig design. It's got a clear and steady style, showing how this student's skills are both polished and creative. This brand isn't just about showing off; it's about making bonds and showing how those big thoughts and cool designs can be buddies.
    	<p>Think of the many different users this website is addressing. If I were to write down the characteristics of any of these users and label them, I would create a persona. Personas are composite sketches that reflect end users' real-world behaviors, attributes, and attitudes. Here are 3 personas that I think would use my website:<span>
